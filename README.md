# Dotfiles

This repo comes with a handy tool called [dotdrop](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop). It helps to manage various dotfiles and install them as well.

Here are some handy commands to help get started:
- Adding files/directories to the repo to be symlinked when installing: `./dotdrop.sh import --link=link <file>`
- Comparing files in the repo with what's set up in `~` already: `./dotdrop.sh compare [--profile=<profile_name>]`
- Installing files (see `config.yaml` for profiles - you may need to create one): `./dotdrop.sh install [--profile=<profile_name>]`
